# ElasticDataSearchEngine


## Setup Instructions:

# Step-1: Download , Install and Run Elastic-Search 6.4.3

This section includes information on how to setup Elasticsearch and get it running, including:

1. Downloading
2. Installing
3. Starting
4. Configuring

Java (JVM):

- Elasticsearch is built using Java, and requires at least Java 8 in order to run. Only Oracle‚Äôs Java and the OpenJDK are supported.

- The same JVM version should be used on all Elasticsearch nodes and clients.

- We recommend installing Java version 1.8.0_131 or a later version in the Java 8 release series.

- We recommend using a supported LTS version of Java. Elasticsearch will refuse to start if a known-bad version of Java is used.

- The version of Java that Elasticsearch will use can be configured by setting the JAVA_HOME environment variable.

Mac OSX:

# Install va homebrew

If you don't have homebrew installed -  [get homebrew here](http://brew.sh/)

Then run:  `brew install elasticsearch`

# Configuration

Update the elasticsearch configuration file in ` /usr/local/etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml`.

Set the value below to false:

    discovery.zen.ping.multicast.enabled: false #(it's true by default)

# How to start it

Other sources say to use a removed `brew services` command. You get it via `brew tap gapple/services`. Then you're supposed to run `brew services start <package-to-start>`.

If brew `services start elasticsearch` doesn't work for you, check the instructions when you run `brew info elasticsearch`.

To have launchd start elasticsearch now and restart at login:
  brew services start elasticsearch
Or, if you don't want/need a background service you can just run:
  elasticsearch

Windows:
```
- The zip and tar.gz packages are suitable for installation on any system and are the easiest choice for getting started with Elasticsearch on most systems.

- Install Elasticsearch with .zip or .tar.gz or Install Elasticsearch with .zip on Windows

```
Linux:

1. apt-get update

2. apt-get install -y elasticsearch

```


# Running Elasticsearch from the command line:

1. Elasticsearch can be started from the command line as follows:

./bin/elasticsearch

By default, Elasticsearch runs in the foreground, prints its logs to the standard output (stdout), and can be stopped by pressing Ctrl-C.

2. Running as a daemon:

To run Elasticsearch as a daemon, specify -d on the command line, and record the process ID in a file using the -p option:

./bin/elasticsearch -d -p pid

3. Log messages can be found in the $ES_HOME/logs/ directory.

4. To shut down Elasticsearch, kill the process ID recorded in the pid file:

kill `cat pid`

Note:
The startup scripts provided in the RPM and Debian packages take care of starting and stopping the Elasticsearch process for you.
